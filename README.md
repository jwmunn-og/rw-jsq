## So you think you know JavaScript?

Thank you for taking the Republic Wireless JavaScript quiz!

Here, you should find five .js files containing problems and illustrative examples for a variety of
pertinent topics in JavaScript programming. Most problems require you to write one or more
functions that satisfy a description. The majority of solutions should require less than ten lines
of code, but none should require more than forty.

You should write JavaScript that will run in old browsers that only support ECMAScript 3 (ES3).
Please don't concern yourself with writing code to check for bad arguments or to throw exceptions.
Your solutions should be simple and transparent enough that any errors arising from their usage
should be easy to understand. For example, a utility function that invokes an undefined value as a
function will naturally throw a TypeError. It should be pretty easy for the utility's user to
understand what went wrong without the need for additional code that performs a type check and
redundantly throws a TypeError.

Some questions are harder than others, and some questions build on each other, so read through and
try to solve the easiest problems first. A reasonable ordering of the problem files from easiest
to most difficult is:

iteration.js
  * Explore and implement fundamental iteration utilities for arrays and objects

prototypes.js
  * Demonstrate your understanding of prototypal inheritance and write utilities to simplify
    its usage

binding.js
  * Show your mastery of the elusive *this* context and its interaction with JavaScript's model of
    the *Function* object

closures.js
  * Prove that you are intimate with functional programming and its possibilities

promises.js
  * Stretch your grasp of promises by writing utilities for handling common asynchronous
    programming scenarios
